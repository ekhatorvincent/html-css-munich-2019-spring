<p>An easy and quick recipe for Nigeria food
    Nigerian tomato stew is a favourite in every Nigerian <br />home and there’s nothing as tasty and simple as white
    rice and tomato stew. I have always loved tomato <br />stew and white rice as we fondly call it in Nigeria. I love
    making my own stew but I also enjoy tasting stew made <br />by other people, it’s always amazing how stew can<br />
    have different unique flavors and tastes when prepared by different people even <br />with the same ingredients.
    Stew is very versatile as it can be served with different <br /> types of sides such as steamed rice, boiled or
    fried yam, plantains, potatoes, egusi soup, okra soup and even bread…Yes, <br />I love stew and fresh ‘out of the
    oven bread’ </p>
